# Belly Button Biodiversity With Plot.ly

In this project, I built an interactive dashboard using the D3 library to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Visit this webpage to take a look at the dashboard!
